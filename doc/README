This is a recursive version of the maze solver.
Given a maze, a starting point, and an ending point, 
the maze solver will find the path that connects 
the starting point with the ending point.

Compile this project with Ant from the command line using the "build.xml" file:
$ ant -f build.xml

Then you should see a "release" folder containing the Jar file.

Run the Jar file adding the path to the Maze details as:
$ java -jar mazesolver.jar /file/path/to/the/file/containing/the/details/of/the/match
